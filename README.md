This repository represents the official implementation of the paper titled "Driving-Video Dehazing with Non-Aligned Regularization for Safety Assistance".

## Video demo
To validate the stability of our video dehazing results, we present a video result captured in a real driving
environment and compare it with the latest video dehazing state-of-the-art method, MAP-Net.

## Our pipeline
Our method effectively trains the video dehazing network using real-world hazy and clear videos without requiring strict alignment, resulting in high-quality results.
