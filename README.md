This repository represents the official implementation of the paper titled "Driving-Video Dehazing with Non-Aligned Regularization for Safety Assistance".

## :fire: Updates
- [16-06-2024] Added train and inference code (this repository).
- [15-06-2024] We created the [project homepage](https://fanjunkai1.github.io/projectpage/DVD/index.html) and the GitHub README.

## :mega: Pipeline
Our method effectively trains the video dehazing network using real-world hazy and clear videos without requiring strict alignment, resulting in high-quality results.

The overall framework of our driving-video dehazing (DVD) comprising two crucial components: frame matching and video
dehazing. This involves applying frame dehazing to proactively eliminate haze from individual frames. One significant benefit is the
effectiveness and efficiency of our method in training the video dehazing network using authentic driving data without requiring strict
alignment, ultimately producing high-quality results. (b) The illustration depicts the matching process of non-aligned, clear reference
frames through the utilization of an adaptive sliding window using the feature cosine similarity. **Our input consists of two frames**.


## 💡 GoProHazy, DrivingHazy (real-world hazy video datasets)

<img src = "figs/collection-device.png" width='410' height='200'><img src = "figs/collection-method.png" width='410' height='200'>


To collect pairs of hazy/clear video pairs, follow these steps: 
1). As illustrated in Collection Method (a), we capture hazy videos in various scenes under hazy weather conditions. 
2). In Collection Method (b), to maintain consistent scene brightness, we choose overcast days with good visibility for capturing clear video pairs. 
    Additionally, to ensure the reference clear video matches the hazy scene, we align clear video capture with the starting point of the hazy videos. 
3). Video cropping is employed to ensure that the starting and ending points of the collected hazy/clear video pairs are consistent.

|   Frame Dehazing   |   Frame dehazing module was pre-trained on misaligned hazy/clear image paired data.                                                         | <a href="">Baidu Disk</a>|

2. Organize data for training, using GoProHazy as an example, as follow:

~~~
{DVD ROOT}
|-- pre_dehazing
|   |-- models
|   |   |-- remove_hazy_model_256x256.pth
|-- pretrained
|   |-- spynet_sintel_final-3d2a1287.pth
|-- datasets
|   |-- foggy_video
|   |   |-- train_video
|   |   |   |-- TrainClipsFrames
|   |   |   |   |-- hazyframe_seq
|   |   |   |   |   |-- 00001_hazyframe_seq
|   |   |   |   |   |   |-- 00001
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |-- frame_0_hazy.jpg
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |-- frame_1_hazy.jpg
|   |   |   |   |   |   |-- ...
|   |   |   |   |-- clearframe
|   |   |   |   |   |-- 00001_clearframe
|   |   |   |   |   |   |-- 00001
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |-- frame_0_clear.jpg
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |-- frame_1_clear.jpg
|   |   |   |   |   |   |-- ...
|   |   |   |-- TrainMatchFrames   
|   |   |   |   |-- 1_hazy&clear_frames.txt
|   |   |   |   |-- ...
|   |   |-- test_video
|   |   |-- val_video

|-- data
|   |--meta_info
|   |  |-- meta_info_GoPro_train_frames_seq.txt
|   |  |-- meta_info_GoPro_test_frames_seq.txt
|   |  |-- meta_info_GoPro_val_frames_seq.txt
~~~

**Note**: For organizing the data structure above, you can use the script we provide with the following commands:
```
python reorganize_data.py --input_frames_num 2  
--index_txt_path ./datasets/foggy_video/train_video/TrainMatchFrames
--save_hazyframe_seq_path ./datasets/foggy_video/train_video/TrainClipsFrames/hazyframe_seq  
--save_clearframe_path ./datasets/foggy_video/train_video/TrainClipsFrames/clearframe
```
```
python generate_meta_info.py --hazyframe_path ./datasets/foggy_video/train_video/TrainClipsFrames/hazyframe_seq
--clearframe_path ./datasets/foggy_video/train_video/TrainClipsFrames/clearframe
--save_meta_info_path ./data/meta_info/meta_info_GoPro_train_frames_seq.txt
```
## 🏋️ Training and Testing

Train our DVD by
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python3.9 -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=2 --master_port=4321 train.py -opt options/train/train_DVD.yml --launcher pytorch
```
Test our DVD by

```


## ⚡ Inference DVD

Firstly, place the trained model in the `checkpoint/DVD` folder, then place the video frames to be tested in the `input_video_frame` folder, and check the inference results in the `out_video_frame` folder.
```
python inference_single_video.py --visual_enhance_model_path checkpoint/DVD/net_g_latest.pth
--input_path input_video_frame
--dehazing_model_path pre_dehazing/models/remove_hazy_model_256x256.pth
--save_path output_video_frame
```

## 📊 Results
<img src = "figs/results.png" width='840' height='260'>
Quantitative results on three real-world hazy video datasets. ↓ denotes the lower the better. ↑ denotes the higher the better. Due
to PM-Net and MAP-Net rely on GT for training, we use Lcx to train them on GoProHazy dataset. Note that we only selected the latest
dehazing methods (i.e., RIDCP, PM-Net and MAP-Net) and our DVD for the user study. Moreover, DrivingHazy and InternetHazy were
tested on dehazing models trained using GoProHazy and pre-trained dehazing models provided by the authors, respectively.

## 🎬 Video demo
To validate the stability of our video dehazing results, we present a video result captured in a real driving
environment and compare it with the latest video dehazing state-of-the-art method, MAP-Net.
